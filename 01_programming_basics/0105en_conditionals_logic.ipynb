    "Conditionals are statements in programming that allow you to make decisions based on certain conditions. They allow your code to perform different actions based on whether a condition is true or false. Conditionals are the foundation for decision-making in programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, conditionals are mainly achieved using `if`, `elif` (short for 'else if'), and `else` statements. They follow a specific syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code to execute when the condition is true\n",
    "\n",
    "elif condition:\n",
    "    # code to execute when the previous condition is false and this condition is true\n",
    "\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code to execute when none of the previous conditions are true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how conditionals work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `if` statement checks a given condition. If the condition is true, the code inside the block following the `if` statement is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optionally, you can include one or more `elif` statements after the `if` statement. These statements also check condition, but only if the preceding conditions in the `if` and other `elif` statements are false. If condition evaluates to true, the code inside the corresponding `elif` block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If none of the conditions in the `if` and `elif` statements are true, the program executes the code inside the `else` block (if provided), as it acts as a catch-all."

    "Comparison operators are used to compare two values or expressions and evaluate their relationship. They return either True or False based on the result of the comparison. These operators are often used within conditionals to check conditions and determine the flow of the program.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Equal to (`==`): Checks if the values on both sides are equal.\n",
    "- Not equal to (`!=`): Checks if the values on both sides are not equal.\n",
    "- Greater than (`>`): Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.\n",
    "- Less than (`<`): Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.\n",
    "- Greater than or equal to (`>=`): Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.\n",
    "- Less than or equal to (`<=`): Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.\n",
